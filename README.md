📌 Introduction
The Spotify Data Analysis project is designed to:

Explore Spotify's music data using data science techniques.
Analyze song features like danceability, energy, valence, and tempo.
Understand patterns in music trends and song popularity.
Handle missing data and clean the dataset for meaningful analysis.
By extracting insights from this data, the project aims to uncover how different features influence song popularity and user engagement.

📂 Exploring the Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes key features of Spotify tracks such as:

Track Metadata: Track Name, Artist, Release Date, Genre
Audio Features: Danceability, Energy, Tempo, Loudness, Speechiness, etc.
Popularity Metrics: Popularity Score
Initial exploration includes:

Loading the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Displaying the first few rows using df.head() to understand its structure.

🔎 Extracting Insights from the Dataset through Analysis
The project uncovers patterns and trends by:

Analyzing Popularity: Correlating features like danceability and energy with popularity.
Visualizing Trends: Using line charts and scatterplots to showcase trends in tempo, loudness, and other features over time.
Genre-Based Analysis: Grouping data by genres to identify distinct patterns.
Feature Correlation: Heatmaps to visualize relationships between features.
